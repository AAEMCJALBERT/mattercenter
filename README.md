# mattercenter
Matter Center is a solution that helps legal professionals improve productivity by integrating core Office 365 document management (e.g. SharePoint) and collaboration (e.g. OneDrive for Business) directly into the tools they use most, namely Word and Outlook. It is a solution built by LCA using the Office app dev model, and has been designed not just for our own internal use, but for partners and customers to use as an example to build value on top of Microsoft's productivity platform.
